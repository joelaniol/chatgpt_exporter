# Quiet Signal

This icon language uses compact geometry to communicate trust under load. The form is simple, but every edge is deliberate: a rounded square container, a chat bubble core, and a directional arrow as a precise action cue. The composition should feel meticulously crafted, with clear hierarchy and no visual noise.

Color is used as structure, not decoration. A cool blue gradient anchors reliability and technical focus, while a bright accent marks movement and completion. Contrast is controlled with painstaking attention so the mark stays legible at tiny sizes and still feels premium at larger sizes.

Scale and rhythm are intentionally calm. The icon should read in one glance on crowded extension bars, with balanced negative space and carefully weighted shapes. The silhouette must remain stable across 16px through 128px, preserving identity without detail collapse.

Craftsmanship is non-negotiable: this is a master-level micro-mark, refined for clarity, consistency, and speed of recognition. Every radius, stroke weight, and spacing decision is tuned to look deliberate, polished, and production-ready.
